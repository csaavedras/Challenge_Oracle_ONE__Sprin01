## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  We can see the complete result of the requested UI, based on Figma's designs, with a complete responsive experience.
- What was your experience?
  It was an entertaining experience, I followed step by step the support we had in the Trello app.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I started this challenge with the skill that had the least difficulty for me, that is, transforming a design to HTML/CSS, and then solving the logic of the application. Finally, I divided the logic of my program into smaller problems and separated them into functions to achieve each goal.Apply and use the following concepts: objects, addEventListener, querySelector, preventDefault(), regex expressions, replace() and other elements for DOM manipulation.
